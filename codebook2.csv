Rule Context,"""With respect to the Atlantic herring fishery, the Rule created an industry funded program that aims to ensure observer coverage on 50 percent of trips undertaken by vessels
with certain types of permits. Under that program, vessel
representatives must “declare into” a fishery before beginning a trip by notifying NMFS of the trip and announcing
the species the vessel intends to harvest. If NMFS determines that an observer is required, but declines to assign a
Government-paid one, the vessel must contract with and
pay for a Government-certified third-party observer.
NMFS estimated that the cost of such an observer would be
up to $710 per day, reducing annual returns to the vessel
owner by up to 20 percent. See id., at 7417–7418."""

Fed. Reg. Context,"""The MSA does not contain similar terms addressing
whether Atlantic herring fishermen may be required to
bear costs associated with any observers a plan may mandate. And at one point, NMFS fully funded the observer
coverage the New England Fishery Management Council
required in its plan for the Atlantic herring fishery. See 79
Fed. Reg. 8792 (2014). In 2013, however, the council proposed amending its fishery management plans to empower
it to require fishermen to pay for observers if federal funding became unavailable. Several years later, NMFS promulgated a rule approving the amendment. See 85 Fed. Reg.
7414 (2020)."""

Agency Policy Direction,1
Policy Direction Context,"""Before 1976, unregulated foreign vessels dominated fishing in the international waters off the U. S. coast, which began just 12 nautical miles offshore. See, e.g., S. Rep.
No. 94–459, pp. 2–3 (1975). Recognizing the resultant overfishing and the need for sound management of fishery resources, Congress enacted the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (MSA). See 90 Stat.
331 (codified as amended at 16 U. S. C. §1801 et seq.). The
MSA and subsequent amendments extended the jurisdiction of the United States to 200 nautical miles beyond the
U. S. territorial sea and claimed “exclusive fishery management authority over all fish” within that area, known as the
“exclusive economic zone.”"
Deference,0
Deference Context,"""It prescribes no deferential standard for courts to employ in answering those legal questions, despite mandating deferential judicial review of agency policymaking and factfinding. See §§706(2)(A), (E). And by directing courts
to “interpret constitutional and statutory provisions” without differentiating between the two, §706, it makes clear that agency interpretations of statutes—like agency interpretations of the Constitution—are
not entitled to deference. The APA’s history and the contemporaneous
views of various respected commentators underscore the plain meaning of its text."""

Expertise in Opinion,1
Expertise Context  in Opinion,"For those reasons, delegating ultimate interpretive authority to agencies is simply not necessary to ensure that
the resolution of statutory ambiguities is well informed by
subject matter expertise. The better presumption is therefore that Congress expects courts to do their ordinary job of
interpreting statutes, with due respect for the views of the
Executive Branch. And to the extent that Congress and the
Executive Branch may disagree with how the courts have
performed that job in a particular case, they are of course
always free to act by revising the statute"

Expertise in Dissent,1
Expertise Context in Dissent,"Congress would usually think agencies the better choice to resolve the ambiguities and fill the gaps in regulatory statutes. Because agencies are “experts in the field.” And because they are part of a political branch, with a claim to making interstitial policy. And because Congress has charged them, not us, with administering  [**910]  the statutes containing the open questions. At its core, Chevron is about respecting that allocation of responsibility—the [***154]  conferral of primary authority over regulatory matters to agencies, not courts."

And of course Congress has conferred on that expert, experienced, and politically accountable agency the authority to administer—to make rules about and otherwise implement—the statute giving rise to the ambiguity or gap."

not supposed to defer when the agency construing a statute
(1) has not been charged with administering that law; (2)
has not used deliberative procedures—i.e., notice-and-comment rulemaking or adjudication; or (3) is intervening in a
“major question,” of great economic and political significance."

Chevron (1984) Cited,2
Chevron Context,"""The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, and courts may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous; Chevron is overruled"""
Mead (2001) Cited,2
Mead Context,"Consider the many refinements we have made in an effort to match Chevron’s presumption to reality. We have
said that Chevron applies only “when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make
rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.” Mead, 533 U. S., at 226–227. In
practice, that threshold requirement—sometimes called
Chevron “step zero”—largely limits Chevron to “the fruits of
notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication.”
533 U. S., at 230. But even when those processes are used,
deference is still not warranted “where the regulation is
‘procedurally defective’—that is, where the agency errs by
failing to follow the correct procedures in issuing the regulation.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U. S. 211,
220 (2016) (quoting Mead, 533 U. S., at 227)."
MVMA v. State Farm (1983) cited:,1
State Farm Context,"When the best reading of a statute is that it delegates discretionary authority to an agency, the role of the reviewing court under the APA is, as always, to independently interpret the statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits. The court fulfills that role by recognizing constitutional delegations, “fix[ing] the boundaries of [the] delegated authority,” H. Monaghan, Marbury and the Administrative State, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 27 (1983), and ensuring the agency has engaged in “‘reasoned decisionmaking’ ” within those boundaries, Michigan, 576 U. S., at 750 (quoting Allentown Mack Sales & Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U. S. 359, 374 (1998)); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29 (1983). By doing so, a court upholds the traditional conception of the judicial function that the APA adopts."

NOTES:,NA
summary,"In  Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, the SCOTUS ruled that in accordance with the APA, the courts have the right to review statuatory provisions made by federal agencies. The Magnuson-Stevenson Act led to the NMFS requiring some private fishing vessels to bear the cost of having federal observors that were there to enforce fishing standards. Petitioners argued that the MSA did not explicitly require private vessels to pay for federal observors, and the Majority opinion agreed along. This effectively overturned the Chevron doctrine that delegated reasonable interperation to agencies on ambiguous acts. The decision was along ideological lines, with Roberts (majority opinion) writing that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires courts to independently interpret statutory provisions, even if ambiguous, without defaulting to agency interpretations."
